      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The ultimate goal is to make the inaccessible easily accessible. Dry Oar is is dedicates to bringing 
        the wondrous great outdoors to adventurers. To achieve this, a web page is needed to provide trip information, 
        available booking, price, and an environment that educes adventure. Information that is required for this 
        site includes a bit about the company such as a mission statement, what trips are available, and costumer 
        reviews. There also needs to be a page that is dedicated to booking so customers can easily see what trips 
        are available including locations, duration, and how many spots are available for each trip, so planning 
        a fantastic outing is a breeze. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience are adventurers of all kinds and levels. The goal is to have options for people who 
        want hardcore adventure and people who are looking to simply spend time outdoors. The goal is to have something 
        for everyone as people visiting the site want to go river rafting. Dry Oar is providing guides and equipment 
        for these trips so people can enjoy the sport without having to spend thousands on the equipment. We are also 
        providing a safe experience with experienced guides so everyone can be safe while having fun. The site will 
        likely be accessed by mobile devices as Dry Oar doesn’t have a large online presence so a lot of the traffic 
        will probably come from the existing posters and information boards that are posted. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- You are not required to use this logo for your site…but you must have a logo for your website.  I can offer additional logos to use, or you can create your own-->

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/7e6c6c-f87575-ffa9a3-b9e6ff-5c95ff" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#396E94]</td><td class="secondary">[#E7C24F]</td><td class="accent1">[#A43312]</td><td class="accent2"></td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Courior New  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font feels rustic and there is something rustic associated with roughing it in the 
        woods.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The sans serif is a complementery font as it is nice and simple.
        Corrior New headlines can feel a little clunky so this helps balance it out.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
