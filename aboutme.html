        <p>Hello Internet! Here is a bit about me. </p>

        <p>Currently I’m expanding my knowledge of programming and web design as I have learned the basics 
            of a couple programming languages including C, Python, and Ruby. I have even dabbled in HTML, 
            though I cant say I really enjoyed HTML as it really isn’t structured like a programming language. 
            That aside, I’m looking forward to learning a bit more about web design as I tend to spend a lot of time navigating them.</p>

        <p>I also love the great outdoors, my favorite activities include backpacking, hiking, 
            rock climbing, caving (spelunking if you prefer the fancy term), and cross-country skiing. 
            Most of my adventures are pretty simple though I love an excuse to spend a few days camping far from roads and people.
             Most of my favorite hikes are around 10 miles round trip though if I’m backpacking I love a trip 
             that covers a lot of ground; for example, one of my favorite trips this last summer was 2 nights and over 20 miles long!
             Climbing is another outdoor past time that I enjoy. Especially when I fall 15 feet 
             and get caught by a rope. Though it can definitely get really nerve racking, so maybe don’t pick up 
             rock climbing if you are afraid of heights. The same would probably go with caving as most of the 
             caves I explore you have to repel into. For example the entrance pit for one of my favorite caves is 
             over 300 feet deep and opens up to a cavern that could fit several houses inside. So as you can see I love to be IN the outdoors.</p>

        <p>I’m also a pretty avid gamer whether it’s ultimate Frisbee, chess, or a computer game I’m all in. 
            One thing I love about games is the opportunity to create a strategy and use that strategy to crush the competition. 
            I can’t say that I’m super competitive but I do enjoy a competitive environment where everyone does there best to win. 
            I also really love games that have technical elements as well where there are often problems that 
            come up for the player to solve, some of my favorites in this area are Trailmakers and Minecraft.</p>

        <p>So there are a few things about me and my hobbies. I’m both a geek, outdoor nut, gamer, and a perspective 
            electrical engineer. I’m looking forward to studying web design with you all. </p>
