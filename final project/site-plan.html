      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Adventures are better with friends, but often times itâ€™s hard to find people who are willing to go on trips. So how can a web page help? Building a forum would allow outdoor enthusiasts invite others and join others on trips. Having a forum would also be a great place to be able to ask questions about what gear to get, and about trail conditions. Making planning and going on trips safer, cheaper, and more enjoyable.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site will be targeted towards adventurers. The idea of a forum would be to create flexibility but due to the circumstances the site will be geared towards hikers and backpackers. The goal is to hit all levels from the ultra light thru hikers to beginners wondering what to buy for their first trip. So the target it anyone who wants a second opinion on gear, hiking tips, trails, and general practice.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Arial Black  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I want something that will have a clean conservitive feel hence the sans-serif. Arial Black is bold and stands out so I plan on using it for the headers.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Arial  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        once again going for a clean feel.   <!-- change this -->
